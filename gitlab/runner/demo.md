If your GitLab Runner hasn’t contacted the GitLab instance in a while, here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

---

### **Step 1: Verify GitLab Runner Service Status**
Check whether the GitLab Runner service is running:

#### On Linux:
```bash
sudo systemctl status gitlab-runner
```

- If it’s not active, start it:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl start gitlab-runner
  ```

- To ensure it runs on boot:
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl enable gitlab-runner
  ```

#### On Windows:
1. Open `Services` (Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and press Enter).
2. Look for the `GitLab Runner` service.
3. If it’s stopped, start it.

---

### **Step 2: Verify Internet or Network Connection**
Since you're on a self-hosted GitLab instance:
- Ensure the machine hosting the runner can reach the GitLab instance.
  ```bash
  ping <gitlab-instance-hostname>
  ```
- If the runner is behind a firewall or proxy, ensure the appropriate ports are open:
  - Default HTTP: **80**
  - Default HTTPS: **443**

---

### **Step 3: Validate Runner Registration**
Verify the `config.toml` file to ensure the runner is correctly registered:

```bash
sudo cat /etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml
```

- Check for:
  - **URL**: It should match your GitLab instance URL.
  - **Token**: Ensure the token matches the registration token from your GitLab project.

---

### **Step 4: Update GitLab Runner**
An outdated GitLab Runner version can cause connectivity issues. Update the runner to the latest version:

#### On Linux:
```bash
sudo gitlab-runner stop
sudo curl -L --output /usr/bin/gitlab-runner https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/binaries/gitlab-runner-linux-amd64
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/gitlab-runner
sudo gitlab-runner start
```

#### On Windows:
- Download the latest binary from [GitLab's official page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/releases) and replace the existing binary.

---

### **Step 5: Re-register the Runner**
If the runner is still not working, re-register it:

1. Unregister the current runner:
   ```bash
   gitlab-runner unregister --all-runners
   ```

2. Re-register the runner using the steps outlined earlier.

---

### **Step 6: Check Logs**
Inspect the runner logs to identify the problem:

#### On Linux:
```bash
sudo journalctl -u gitlab-runner
```

#### On Windows:
Check the logs in the GitLab Runner’s installation directory.

---

### **Step 7: Test Connectivity**
Run the following command to ensure the runner can communicate with GitLab:
```bash
gitlab-runner verify
```

If the runner cannot connect, you might see errors indicating network or authentication problems.

---

### **Step 8: Check GitLab Instance Logs**
If none of the above resolves the issue, check your self-hosted GitLab logs to ensure the problem isn’t on the server side:
1. Look for errors in GitLab logs (`/var/log/gitlab/`).
2. Check if the runner was blocked or disabled in GitLab.

---

### **Step 9: Restart GitLab Services**
Sometimes restarting GitLab services on the self-hosted instance resolves issues:
```bash
sudo gitlab-ctl restart
```

---

### **Step 10: Verify and Retest**
After completing these steps, push a new commit to a project using the runner to trigger a pipeline and verify it works.

If the issue persists, let me know the exact error message or symptoms for further assistance!
