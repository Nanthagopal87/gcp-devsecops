- **Pipeline Configuration**:
  - YAML syntax for `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
  - Using built-in CI/CD templates and defining custom workflows.
- **Integration**:
  - Understand how to integrate pipelines with external tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, or cloud services.

---

### **7. Monitoring and Logging**
- **Monitoring Tools**:
  - Familiarize yourself with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring GitLab performance.
- **Logs**:
  - Learn to analyze GitLab logs for debugging (application logs, database logs, and runner logs).
- **Alerting**:
  - Set up alerts for system health and pipeline failures.

---

### **8. Backups and Disaster Recovery**
