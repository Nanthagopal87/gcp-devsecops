### 1. Artifact
An artifact is any file generated or used in a Maven project, typically a .jar (Java archive) file, but it could also be a .war file, source archive, or metadata file.

### 2. Plugins
Plugins are core components that provide functionality to the Maven build process. They execute specific tasks, like compiling code, running tests, packaging applications, and deploying artifacts.

### 3. Archetype
An archetype in Maven is a template for generating a new project structure. Archetypes simplify the setup of new projects by providing predefined project structures and configurations.
