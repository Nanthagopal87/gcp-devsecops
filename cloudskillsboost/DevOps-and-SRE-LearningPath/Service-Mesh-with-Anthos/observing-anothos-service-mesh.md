### AHYBRID041 Observing Anthos Services 

https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/13/course_templates/435/labs/427979

## Overview

In this lab, you learn to install Cloud Service Mesh (CSM) on Google Kubernetes Engine. Cloud Service Mesh is a managed service based on Istio, the leading open source service mesh.

A service mesh gives you a framework for connecting, securing, and managing microservices. It provides a networking layer on top of Kubernetes with features such as advanced load balancing capabilities, service-to-service authentication, and monitoring without requiring any changes in service code.

Cloud Service Mesh has a suite of additional features and tools that help you observe and manage secure, reliable services in a unified way. In this lab you also learn how to use some of these features:

    Service metrics and logs for HTTP(S) traffic within your mesh's GKE cluster are automatically ingested to Google Cloud.
    Preconfigured service dashboards give you the information you need to understand your services.
    In-depth telemetry lets you dig deep into your metrics and logs, filtering and slicing your data on a wide variety of attributes.
    Service-to-service relationships at a glance help you understand who connects to which service and the services that each service depends on.
    Service-level objectives (SLOs) provide insights into the health of your services. You can easily define an SLO and alert on your own standards of service health.

Cloud Service Mesh is the easiest and richest way to implement an Istio-based service mesh on your GKE Enterprise clusters.

## Objectives

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Install Cloud Service Mesh, with tracing enabled and configured to use Cloud Trace as the backend.
- Deploy Bookinfo, an Istio-enabled multi-service application.
- Enable external access using an Istio Ingress Gateway.
- Use the Bookinfo application.
- Evaluate service performance using Cloud Trace features within Google Cloud.
- Create and monitor service-level objectives (SLOs).
- Leverage the Cloud Service Mesh Dashboard to understand service performance.

### Task 1. Install Cloud Service Mesh with tracing enabled

### Task 2. Install the microservices-demo application on the cluster

### Task 3. Review Google Cloud's operations suite functionality

### Task 4. Deploy a canary release that has high latency

### Task 5. Define your service level objective

### Task 6. Diagnose the problem

### Task 7. Roll back the release and verify an improvement

### Task 8. Visualize your mesh with the Cloud Service Mesh dashboard
