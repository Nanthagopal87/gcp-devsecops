### Introduction to SQL for BigQuery and Cloud SQL

https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/11/course_templates/625/labs/464386

## Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for data operations that allows you to ask questions and get insights from structured datasets. It's commonly used in database management and allows you to perform tasks like transaction record writing into relational databases and petabyte-scale data analysis.

This lab is divided into two parts: in the first half, you will learn fundamental SQL querying keywords, which you will run in BigQuery on a public dataset that contains information on London bikeshares.

In the second half, you will learn how to export subsets of the London bikeshare dataset into CSV files, which you will then upload to Cloud SQL. From there you will learn how to use Cloud SQL to create and manage databases and tables. Towards the end, you will get hands-on practice with additional SQL keywords that manipulate and edit data.

## What you'll learn

In this lab, you will learn how to:

- Read data into BigQuery.
- Execute simple queries in BigQuery to explore data.
- Export a subset of data into a CSV file and store that file in a new Cloud Storage bucket.
- Create a new Cloud SQL instance and load your exported CSV file as a new table.
