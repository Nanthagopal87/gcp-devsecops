### 3. Cloud Native Solutions

### 4. Containerization vs Orchestration

### 5. DevOps vs DevSecOps

### 6. Continuous Devlivery
- Continuous delivery is a practice where code changes are automatically prepeared for a release to production.

- What is CI/CD?
   It's a way implement Continuoud Delivery

- Build Pipeline
- Deployment Pipeline

DEV->QA->

Automate and secure Build pipeline
Automate and secure Deployment pipeline


Build is process where we take src convert into a artifact which can be consumed by QA or Consumer.

- DEV
    - Unit test
    - Commit and Push







Traditional following methos for Building-> Nightly Builld:

Developer1,2,3 are frequwntly change the code, do the unit testing internall and commit and push the code the Source code Repository.

For QA testing, will build the artifact from the source code, there will be 2 scenarios
- Build is success
- Build is failed

For Failed Scenarios,
1) We need to ask QA for wait, continuous testing is not happening.

2) We need to ask Developer to fix the code. Here confson which  developer need to ask.

This will cause continous delivery will get delay. 
- More time to find bugs
- Release is delayed

Solutions: To Overcome this issue and enable Continous Delivery

Continuous Integration:
- CI is practise that helps to frequently integrate code changes into a central repository and then automate Builds.

- Find Bugs faster
- Faster releases
- Improves quality
